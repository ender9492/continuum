# Docs

## Purpose
Design docs for Continuum XR (CXR): architecture, terminology, decisions, and roadmap context.

## What belongs here
- Architecture overview and diagrams
- Interface/contract definitions (plain language first)
- Decision records (why we chose X over Y)
- Glossaries and conventions

## Explicitly out of scope (for now)
- End-user documentation
- Installation guides / release notes
- Marketing or feature claims
