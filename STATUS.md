# Project Status

Continuum XR is in early architectural definition.

- There are no builds
- There is no ETA
- There is no supported hardware list
- There is no user-facing functionality yet

The current focus is:
- correctness of architecture,
- clarity of interfaces,
- and long-term maintainability.

Contributions at this stage should focus on:
- documentation,
- interface design,
- terminology consistency,
- and architectural review.

Implementation work will come later, after interfaces and responsibilities are stable.
