# Tools

## Purpose
Developer tooling for building, testing, probing, and diagnosing Continuum XR.

## What belongs here
- Scripts for repo hygiene (format, lint, checks)
- Diagnostics tools (dump status, list capabilities)
- Local dev helpers (generate stubs, validate configs)

## Explicitly out of scope (for now)
- Production installers
- Anything requiring secret keys or proprietary SDKs
- One-off personal scripts that aren’t generalizable
