# Providers

## Purpose
Hardware- and platform-facing modules that supply capabilities to the runtime (pose, input, timing, displays, etc.).

## What belongs here
- Provider interface definitions and reference stubs
- Provider implementations per device/platform (later)
- Capability probing and status reporting (later)

## Explicitly out of scope (for now)
- Shipping “real” implementations
- Vendor blobs or extracted proprietary code
- Reverse-engineered drivers committed from questionable provenance
